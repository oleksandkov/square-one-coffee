# Square One Coffee Research Partnership

> *"At Square 1, we foster belonging by creating community. We own our presence in the community by acting with integrity and generosity."* — Square One Coffee

## Vision

Establish a **learning partnership** with Square One Coffee that systematizes business knowledge, empowers leadership to understand their operations deeply, and builds internal capacity for data-driven inquiry. Through collaborative research and hypothesis testing, we co-create a framework where SOC leadership can ask—and answer—any question about their business using open and internal data sources.

**Our Approach**: We're researchers who consult by helping you learn. Every analysis we conduct becomes a template SOC can adapt. Every question we answer together builds their capacity to explore the next one independently.

**Goal**: Enable SOC to know their business better than anyone else, including themselves at the start of this partnership.

## Objectives

### 1. Systematize Business Knowledge
- **Document** the current state of SOC operations, market position, and competitive landscape
- **Organize** information from open sources (web, social media, public records, reviews)
- **Structure** internal knowledge (operational practices, decision history, institutional memory)
- **Create** a queryable knowledge base that answers: "What do we know about our business?"

### 2. Develop Data Collection Strategies
- **Open Data First** — Maximize use of freely available information (social media, reviews, demographic data, competitor intelligence)
- **Passive Collection** — Design systems to capture operational data without additional staff burden
- **Deliberate Methods** — When needed, employ surveys or observation, but prioritize low-cost approaches
- **Ethical Framework** — Ensure all data collection respects privacy and builds trust

### 3. Test Hypotheses Through Collaborative Analysis
- **Strategic question formulation** — Work with SOC leadership to articulate testable business hypotheses
- **Rigorous analysis** — Apply research methods to answer questions with statistical validity
- **Joint interpretation** — Explain findings, limitations, and implications together
- **Actionable insights** — Translate analysis into decision-relevant recommendations
- **Method documentation** — Show how analyses were conducted so SOC can replicate or adapt

### 4. Build Long-Term Inquiry Capacity
- **Teach analytical thinking** — How to turn business questions into data requirements
- **Co-develop tools** — Dashboards and templates SOC can use independently
- **Knowledge transfer** — Document methods, not just findings
- **Foster curiosity** — Encourage "what if?" questions about operations, customers, markets

## Success Metrics

### Research Quality (Service Excellence)
- Analyses completed with methodological rigor and academic standards
- Hypotheses tested with appropriate statistical methods and clear validity assessment
- Findings actionable, clearly communicated, and decision-relevant
- Turnaround time appropriate to business needs (not just academic timelines)

### Knowledge Systematization (Partnership Foundation)
- Comprehensive business profile document maintained and regularly updated
- Structured repository of open-source intelligence about SOC and market
- Documented data collection protocols for ongoing information gathering

### Capacity Building (Value Differentiation)
- SOC leadership able to independently formulate research questions
- At least 3 strategic hypotheses tested collaboratively per quarter
- SOC team comfortable interpreting data visualizations and statistical summaries
- Evidence of methods being reused or adapted by SOC independently

### Partnership Development (Long-Term Growth)
- Regular engagement (evidence of ongoing relationship, not one-off project)
- SOC proactively requests new analyses as questions emerge
- Referrals or testimonials demonstrating reputation building
- Expanding scope of collaboration over time

## Non-Goals

- **Not traditional consulting** — We don't deliver reports and disappear; we teach while we analyze
- **Not pure research** — We follow SOC's business questions, not our academic agenda
- **Not technology vendor** — We systematize knowledge and build capacity, not sell/deploy software
- **Not creating dependency** — Success = SOC can do more independently, not needing us for routine analyses
- **Not one-off project** — We aim for ongoing partnership as new questions emerge, not single engagement

## What Makes This Partnership Different

**Traditional Consultants**: Deliver expertise → Recommendations → Exit  
**RG-FIDES (Researchers)**: Co-analyze → Insights + Methods → Capacity grows

**We consult by helping you learn:**
- You get answers to your immediate questions (consultancy)
- You learn how to answer similar questions yourself (capacity building)
- You develop a systematic approach to business intelligence (lasting infrastructure)
- You have professional learning partners for complex questions that emerge (ongoing relationship)

## Stakeholders

- **SOC Ownership** (Jonathon & Brandy Brozny): Strategic decision-makers, brand stewards
- **Location Managers** (6 locations): Operational implementers, frontline intelligence
- **SOC Staff**: End users of AI tools, customer insight sources
- **Research Team**: Analysts, methodologists, AI specialists
- **Anecdote Coffee Roasters**: Vertical integration partner (supply chain data)
- **Doorstep Barista**: Subscription service analytics opportunity
